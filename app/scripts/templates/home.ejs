        	<h4>Motivation</h4>
        	<p>We all need to use the same language to communicate a clear message to the public. If we don't, then confusion increases, the message's impact is diluted and voter confidence as a whole is simply eroded.</p>
    
            <p>What's <b>absolutely</b> worse than this is the deliberate act of 'padding down' important and impactful issues through the use of cleverly selected language to describe it. Take for example the term 'The Peace Process': how could anyone argue against it? If you're against the process then by extension you're against peace, right?! Silly you. So, most likley then you will agree with the process whatever it is. Bam, now you're nodding your head to things unthinkable.</p>
    
             <p>Have I got you're attention now? Good.</p>

             <p>The one takeaway you should get from this site is this: <b>Language selection *frames* an issue and therefore sets boudaries on what should and shouldn't be discussed.</b> Most people don't want to go against social and humane norms, so if you position your argument to use the right kind of language, listeners will be nodding their heads in no time, despite the issue and the means. Dangerous stuff.</p>
    
             <p>And so, this application has been designed to scan your written prose and catch any occurrences of bad terms or soft language. Let's use proper language to motivate our discussions. And let's better appreciate the subtlety inherited when picking particular words to talk about an issue. The reward being a vast clarity in our message to the public.</p>
    
             <p>Never stop learning.</p>
